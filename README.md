<h2>Coffee</h2>
<a href="ethiopiahb.jpg">Ethiopia Halo Bariti</a> $14 (happymug)
  <p>This coffee is from the brand new Halo Bariti co-op south of the Yirgacheffe region. The coffee is creamy with a sweet, blueberry flavor. While typical fruit coffees end with an earthy note, this one ends with a sweet creamy flavor. Other notes include lavendar, rose, and raspberry.</p>
<a href="ethiopiak.jpeg">Ethiopia Kochere</a> $17 (manzanita)
  <p>Another coffee near the Yirgacheffe region, the Kochere is a light, floral bean with a tea-like aroma. Notes are reminiscent of lemon and peach tea, with some hints of oranges and melon. This is one of our lighter and more floral coffees, and makes for a great iced coffee as well as a balanced, refreshing hot cup.</p>
<a href="guatemalaah.jpg">Guatemala Antigua Hunapu</a> $15 (manzanita)
  <p>From the slopes of Antigua Valley comes this fresh bean grown in wonderful volcanic soils. The aromas include pear, cherries, and rum, while the flavors range from caramel and dark chocolate to apple and lime. </p>
<a href="guatemalac.jpg">Guatemala Candelaria</a> $17 (stumptown)
  <p>The Candelaria co-op is another group based in Antigua, providing a slightly different take on rich Guatemalan coffee. These beans offer aromas of plum, chocolate, and blood orange. The front notes are molasses and citrus, while the sip ends with a sweet milk chocolate.</p>
<a href="costaricalm.jpg">Costa Rica La Minita</a> $14 (happymug)
  <p>With a consistent cupping score of 92 and higher, La Manita is often nominated one of the best coffees in the world. It has undertones of dark chocolate, with hints of lemon and flowers behind it, and the aftertaste lingers fantastically.</p>
<a href="hunduraslc.jpg">Honduras Las Capucas</a> $15 (kean)
  <p>The first thing you'll notice is how exceptionally smooth this coffee is. It has rich flavors of toffee, milk chocoalte, butter, and apples, and the silky body carries a brown sugar sweetness. The finish is creamy with notes of pecan and molasses.</p>
